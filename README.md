# About

My first project on Android, which I learned and did on my own.

Java and Groovy were used; reverse Polish notation was used to process mathematical expressions, the implementation of which was written on my own.

The application supports different screen sizes and landscape orientation. Localization has also been languages - English. There also light and dark theme.
