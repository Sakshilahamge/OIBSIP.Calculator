# About

My first serious project on Android, which I learned and did on my own. .

Java and Groovy were used; reverse Polish notation was used to process mathematical expressions, the implementation of which was written on my own.

The application supports different screen sizes and landscape orientation. Localization has also been implemented for two languages - Russian and English. There also light and dark theme.

Since at that time I was just starting to program and didnâ€™t really think about the quality of the code, it is at an acceptable level in this project.
